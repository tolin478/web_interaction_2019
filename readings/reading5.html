  <p>1. the assessment of the uniformity of the way images are displayed on the internet is an interesting point.
  a lot of modernist design's core ideas revolved around the fact that the form of something should reflect its
  function. how could this influence how websites that display mainly visual content are designed?</p>

  <p>the new propensity for art to be able to be fully contained in digital images (or even to only exist within
  digital images) means, as the reading mentions, a new development in how art is consumed. i would also add that
  it creates a lot of problems in "ownership" of art. the artist makes the art, of course, but how does distribution
  affect that fact? corporations steal art all the time because of the easy accessibiliity of these images. could
  the design of online modes of art/image sharing somehow ammend this?</p>
