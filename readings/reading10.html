  <p>response</p>

  <p>this piece is something that hits a little too close to home, being that i considered dropping out of
  parsons over the anxiety that design is little more than a tool or toy for the wealthy which isn't what
  i wanted to devote my career to. i think a significant part of this problem is commercial design is
  essentially just an extension of business nowadays, something few can claim is saving the world either.
  velden's declaration at the end that designers should employ research, knowledge, and purpose in their
  designs is something i can agree wholeheartedly with. it has seemed to me that this can be the difference
  between design being frivolous or even harmful, and genuinely addressing an issue. relatedly, to the point
  of problem solving design, i think it's ok if design doesn't solve a problem as long as it engages with
  or identifies one.</p>
