  <h1>reading 8 - top 10 web design styles of 1993</h1>

  <p>response</p>

  <p>while i think studying early web design trends is definitely fascinating, i'm
  reluctant to fall into the pit of thinking that is "the old times were better Because."
  i don't really think the fact that we've developed new ways of designing visuals
  and functionality for the web is bad. just like with any developing technology, it
  opens up new possibilities. the coopting of this ability by companies to create "standards"
  on the other hand is something i can understand being undermining to the craft.</p>
