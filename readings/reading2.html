  <h1>reading 2 - what is code?</h1>

  <p>response questions</p>

  <p>1. both the necessity of this article and what was written in it seems to give credit to the commonly held idea
  that the programming world is somewhat opaque and far removed for those not involved in it. what is it about programming
  that makes it so?</p>

  <p>2. to build off of the first question, "programming" as it is is seen as a somewhat isolated activity/job that is
  only or mostly used by tech companies. could coding be taught/introduced to people in a more interdisciplinary way
  (relating to art/design, business, sciences as it usually does in the real world) as a way to get more people exposed
  to it? i feel this would also help with issues of expanding its demographics beyond white/asian males.</p>
