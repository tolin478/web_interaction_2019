  <h1>reading 9 - apple interface guidelines</h1>

  <p>response</p>

  <p>the ios app design guidelines were honestly far more restrictive than i expected
  them to be. on a basic level, some of the ideas for basic usability were quite helpful for me to
  understand. however, i wasn't fully expecting a brand like apple, whose identity kind of hinges
  on doing what's "new" (though it's certainly debatable to what extent they fulfill that now), to have
  such clear cut expectations. i understand that this is probably written out with pure utilitarianism in
  mind and a framework for people to start with, but it does seem like they're forcing a very specific
  brand of minimalism and predictability.</p>
