  <p>1. i was intrigued by the idea that modern websites/technology are designed to be
    inscrutable/hide their inner workings from users. knowing some things about ux/ui design
    i know this is partially simply to create the supposed "easiest" experience for the userâ€”but i can
    also see how this naturally lends itself to the problems we're facing now of data use,
    malevolent algorithms, and the likes.</p>

  <p>2. the references the author makes to other individual/small scale art movements like zines
  got me imagining what if web design existed as a similar platform. i think part of the issue beyond
  the washing out of "grassroots" web design practices so to speak is a sort of gatekeeping/barrier to entry
  that exists in anything code/tech related. i think creating greater accessibility to tech literacy could
  potentially create new windows for such a movement to emerge.</p>
