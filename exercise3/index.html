    <div class = "section">
    <p>i’m natasha, i’m 21 and at the moment i'm a senior at parsons school of design in new york. i’m from san jose california, a city that i used to kind of hate but now
    have nostalgic attachment to even though all there is to do there is drink boba and
    eat food.</p>

    <p>i do design and technology at parsons, which is a weird and kind of
    unfocused major, so i do all sorts of things like game/mobile/web/ux/ui/ interaction design. i also
    like to do illustration and play video games.</p>

    <p>you can find me elsewhere <a href="https://www.natashatolia.com">here</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/n_tolia_/">here</a>.</p>
