  <p>response questions</p>

  <p>1. laurel schwulst seems to see the potential for websites to be extensions of individuals, whether in creative
    or utilitarian ways. in what ways does the web as it is how encourage and/or discourage individuality?</p>

  <p>2. schwulst also seems to focus on the web as a personal tool. could her ideas for the web similarly be implemented
    in ways that would allow it to be a tool for communities?</p>
